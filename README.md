# Delivery-Dataset
Power BI Based Project

##### This Power BI dashboard explores delivery performance across multiple drivers, focusing on time efficiency, distance traveled, time-of-day effects, and workload distribution.

## Project Objetives
  - The main purpose of this project was to practice my Power BI skill.
    
## Dataset Used
   - <a href="https://github.com/Salah-Adam/Movie-Dataset/blob/main/Movie-Data.xlsx">Dataset</a>

## 🧠 Tools & Features Used
-  Power BI Desktop
##### DAX Measures:
  * `Avg Duration`
  * `Avg Distance`
  * `Delivery Count`
  * `Time of Day` column
  * `Outlier Flag` column
- Visuals: bar charts, line chart, scatter plots, pie charts, matrix, slicers, cards

## 🎯 Business Questions Answered
  1. Who are the most and least efficient drivers?
  2. What time of day has the longest/shortest delivery times?
  3. What is the average travel distance by time of day?
  4. Are some drivers overloaded?
  5. Does the time of day impact delivery performance?
  6.  Are deliveries assigned fairly across drivers?
  7.   Can we identify any inefficiencies or outliers (e.g., long time, short distance)?
  8.   Does time of the day impact number of deliveries made.

##### 📊 Dashboard Highlights
  - ✅ Bar charts for **average duration** and **distance per driver** and **average duration by time of day**.
  - ✅ **Time segmentation** (Morning / Afternoon / Evening).
  - ✅ Scatter plots to show **duration vs. distance** (by driver and delivery).
  - ✅ Card visuals for **max/min duration**, **total drivers**, and **total deliveries**
  - ✅ Matrix breakdown of **deliveries by driver and time of day**.
  - ✅ Pie chart for **delivery count per driver**.
  - ✅ Line chart for **average travel distance by time of day**.

## Key Insights:
  -🕑 **Morning deliveries** are the fastest on average (avg 32.6 min), while **evening deliveries** take the longest (avg 41.3 min).
  - 🚚 **Fatima** completed the most deliveries (13) but had the second highest average delivery duration (44.5 min).
  - 📈 Drivers like **Beatriz** show efficient delivery with short durations despite longer distances.
  - ❗The scatter plot helped flag some **outlier deliveries** — long durations with short distances, indicating potential inefficiencies.
  - 📉 Travel distances are lower in the morning, suggesting **route optimization** opportunities.
  - Almost 50% of deliveries are made during the afternoon, making it the busiest time of day.
